<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

With the constant increase in the amount of data generated by users on the internet, the number of data sources has been increasing and
increasingly diversifying, the process of obtaining data from unusual sources such as articles and even competitor websites has been growing
and with it the need to carry out periodic processes to extract this information, selenium as well as other projects exist to streamline
and automate those processes.
This project comes as learning to perform this extraction in a simple and practical way.

Here's why:
* As a developer we have to be constantly learning and optimizing our knowledge
* When you are learning things , see examples is one of the best ways to start

You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
